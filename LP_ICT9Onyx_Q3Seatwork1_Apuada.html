			<h4>Synopis:</h4><br>
			<p>Ichigo Kurosaki, who is 15 years old, is not like other teenagers, since he has always had the gift of seeing ghosts and spirits. One day, Rukia Kuchiki, a female <em>Shinigami</em> (God of Death), approaches him while searching for an evil spirit. However, Ichigo absorbs the <em>Shinigami</em>'s powers during the battle. The journey of Ichigo and Rukia to herd Hollows (fallen spirits) and battle other supernatural creatures begins here.</p>
